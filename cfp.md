# Call for Papers


Collaboration has become a particularly important topic in model-driven and model-based engineering due to the increasing complexity of systems, which requires a coordinated interplay between diverse stakeholders.
However, collaborative modeling cannot be restricted to purely technical concerns and requires support for efficient communication and reducing the threshold to stakeholder participation.

Complementary to the technical focus of collaborative modeling, participatory modeling focuses on organizing stakeholders into a purposeful process during which models can be elicited. The synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling are clear and it is high time to investigate them in detail.

This workshop aims to unearth the visceral synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling in a full-day format, entertaining technical presentations, keynotes, and a participatory discussion session.


### **Topics of interest**

The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Technical facets of collaborative modeling
  - Real-time and conflict-free collaboration, consistency in collaborative MDE/MBE, conflict management;
  - Version control systems and techniques for asynchronous collaboration;
  - Multi-paradigm, multi-view, and multi-level aspects of collaboration.
- Organizational and human facets of participatory modeling
  - Methods for designing participatory modeling sessions: tools, languages, and facilitation techniques;
  - Involving domain experts without modeling experience;
  - Use cases and preconditions of participatory modeling: when is participatory modeling suitable?
- Synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling; mixed collaboration models.


### **Paper format**

We solicit the following types of papers.
- *Full* research papers (up to 10 pages) reporting on novel scientific contributions
- Short papers (5 pages), including:
  - *Work-in-progress* papers reporting on preliminary results;
  - *Vision* papers outlining new ideas;
  - *Case* papers describing real-life cases;
  - *Tool* papers demonstration of collaborative tools and frameworks;
  - *Tool concept* papers aiming to validate concepts and requirements of tools currently in development.

Note: **page limits include references**!

All submitted papers must adhere to the [ACM Conference](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) format.

LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.

### **Submission**
Manuscripts are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=copamo2024" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=copamo2024</a>.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. 

### **Presentations**
Authors of each accepted paper will be invited to give a *regular* talk.

### **Proceedings**
Accepted papers are intended to be published in the [MODELS](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2024) Companion proceedings and the workshop website. To be published in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers must present their work at the workshop.

#### **General regulations**

- By submitting to CoPaMo, authors acknowledge that they are aware of and agree to be bound by the ACM Policy and Procedures on Plagiarism. In particular, papers submitted to CoPaMo must not have been published elsewhere and must not be under review or submitted for review elsewhere while under consideration for CoPaMo.

- By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM's new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

- Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2024. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.
