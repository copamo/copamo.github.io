# Call for Papers


Collaboration has become a particularly important topic in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) due to the increasing complexity of systems, which requires a coordinated interplay between diverse stakeholders. However, collaborative modeling cannot be restricted to purely technical concerns and requires support for efficient communication and reducing the threshold to stakeholder participation.

Complementary to the technical focus of collaborative modeling, participatory modeling focuses on organizing stakeholders into a purposeful process during which models can be elicited. The synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling are clear and it is high time to investigate them in detail.

This workshop aims to unearth the visceral synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling in a full-day format, entertaining technical presentations, keynotes, and a participatory discussion session.


### **Topics of interest**

The topics of interest include, but are not restricted to:

- Technical facets of collaborative modeling
  - Real-time and conflict-free collaboration, consistency in collaborative MDE/MBE, conflict management;
  - Version control systems and techniques for asynchronous collaboration;
  - Multi-paradigm, multi-view, and multi-level aspects of collaboration;
  - Choosing and designing tools and methods for participation given project needs and participant profiles;
  - Integrating collaborative modeling with emerging AI techniques;
  - HCI and HMI as key enablers of human-AI collaboration.
- Organizational and human facets of participatory modeling
  - Methods for designing participatory modeling sessions: tools, languages, and facilitation techniques;
  - Involving domain experts without modeling experience;
  - Use cases and preconditions of participatory modeling: when is participatory modeling suitable?
- Synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling; mixed collaboration models.


### **Paper format**

We solicit the following types of papers.
- *Full* research papers (up to 10 pages) reporting on novel scientific contributions
- Short papers (5 pages) presenting preliminary results, new ideas, and collaborative tools.

Note: **page limits include references**!

All papers are to be prepared in the double-column [IEEE Conference format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html). 
All submitted papers must adhere to the format.

Please note the [IEEE Authors Rights and Responsibilities](https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/author-rights-responsibilities.html).

Finally, IEEE requires the use of [ORCIDs](https://orcid.org/). LaTeX users should use the “orcidlink” package, `\hypersetup{pdfborder={0 0 0}}`, and `\orcidlink{XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX}` after each author name.

<!-- LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments. -->

### **Submission**
Manuscripts are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=copamo2025" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=copamo2025</a>.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee. 

### **Presentations**
Authors of each accepted paper will be invited to give a *regular* talk.

### **Proceedings**
Accepted papers are intended to be published in the [MODELS](https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2025) Companion proceedings and the workshop website. To be published in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers must present their work at the workshop.

#### **Workshop Format**

This is a full-day workshop. The morning sessions will feature a keynote and technical presentations. The afternoon will continue with a session of technical presentations and conclude with a plenary discussion about collaborative and participatory modeling—aptly following collaborative and participatory principles.
