    <p>Collaborative modeling is an important enabler to engineering complex systems. While mostly
        focusing on the technical and technological aspects of collaboration, the MDE community has
        also recognized the need for more pronounced
        stakeholder-facing concerns in collaborative modeling techniques and tools. Such
        stakeholder-facing concerns are the ones researched
        under the broader participatory modeling umbrella.
        This workshop aims to showcase the latest developments in <b>Co</b>llaborative and <b>Pa</b>rticipatory
        <b>Mo</b>deling, as well as to expose the synergies between collaborative and participatory
        modeling by inviting researchers and organizers from
        both communities.
