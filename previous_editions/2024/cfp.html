  <h1 id="call-for-papers">Call for Papers</h1>

<p>Collaboration has become a particularly important topic in model-driven and model-based engineering due to the increasing complexity of systems, which requires a coordinated interplay between diverse stakeholders.
However, collaborative modeling cannot be restricted to purely technical concerns and requires support for efficient communication and reducing the threshold to stakeholder participation.</p>

<p>Complementary to the technical focus of collaborative modeling, participatory modeling focuses on organizing stakeholders into a purposeful process during which models can be elicited. The synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling are clear and it is high time to investigate them in detail.</p>

<p>This workshop aims to unearth the visceral synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling in a full-day format, entertaining technical presentations, keynotes, and a participatory discussion session.</p>

<h3 id="topics-of-interest"><strong>Topics of interest</strong></h3>

<p>The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Technical facets of collaborative modeling
    <ul>
      <li>Real-time and conflict-free collaboration, consistency in collaborative MDE/MBE, conflict management;</li>
      <li>Version control systems and techniques for asynchronous collaboration;</li>
      <li>Multi-paradigm, multi-view, and multi-level aspects of collaboration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Organizational and human facets of participatory modeling
    <ul>
      <li>Methods for designing participatory modeling sessions: tools, languages, and facilitation techniques;</li>
      <li>Involving domain experts without modeling experience;</li>
      <li>Use cases and preconditions of participatory modeling: when is participatory modeling suitable?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Synergies between collaborative and participatory modeling; mixed collaboration models.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="paper-format"><strong>Paper format</strong></h3>

<p>We solicit the following types of papers.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Full</em> research papers (up to 10 pages) reporting on novel scientific contributions</li>
  <li>Short papers (5 pages), including:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Work-in-progress</em> papers reporting on preliminary results;</li>
      <li><em>Vision</em> papers outlining new ideas;</li>
      <li><em>Case</em> papers describing real-life cases;</li>
      <li><em>Tool</em> papers demonstration of collaborative tools and frameworks;</li>
      <li><em>Tool concept</em> papers aiming to validate concepts and requirements of tools currently in development.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note: <strong>page limits include references</strong>!</p>

<p>All submitted papers must adhere to the <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Conference</a> format.</p>

<p>LaTeX users must use the provided acmart.cls and ACM-Reference-Format.bst without modification, enable the conference format in the preamble of the document (i.e., \documentclass[sigconf,review]{acmart}), and use the ACM reference format for the bibliography (i.e., \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}). The review option adds line numbers, thereby allowing referees to refer to specific lines in their comments.</p>

<h3 id="submission"><strong>Submission</strong></h3>
<p>Manuscripts are to be submitted electronically through EasyChair: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=copamo2024" target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=copamo2024</a>.
All submissions will be reviewed by at least 3 members of the program committee.</p>

<h3 id="presentations"><strong>Presentations</strong></h3>
<p>Authors of each accepted paper will be invited to give a <em>regular</em> talk.</p>

<h3 id="proceedings"><strong>Proceedings</strong></h3>
<p>Accepted papers are intended to be published in the <a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/models-2024">MODELS</a> Companion proceedings and the workshop website. To be published in the proceedings, at least one author of accepted papers must present their work at the workshop.</p>
