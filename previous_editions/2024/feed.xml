While mostly focusing on the technical and technological aspects of  collaboration, the MDE community has also recognized the need for more pronounced stakeholder-facing concerns in collaborative modeling techniques  and tools. Such stakeholder-facing concerns are the ones researched under the broader participatory modeling umbrella. This workshop aims to showcase
 the latest developments in Collaborative and Participatory Modeling, as well as to expose the synergies between collaborative and participatory
  modeling by inviting researchers and organizers from both communities.</subtitle></feed>
