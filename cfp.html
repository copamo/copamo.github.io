    <p>Collaboration has become a particularly important topic in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) due to
        the
        increasing complexity of systems, which requires a coordinated interplay between diverse
        stakeholders.
        However, collaborative modeling cannot be restricted to purely technical concerns and requires
        support for
        efficient communication and reducing the threshold to stakeholder participation.
        <br>
        Complementary to the technical focus of collaborative modeling, participatory modeling focuses
        on
        organizing stakeholders into a purposeful process during which models can be elicited. The
        synergies
        between collaborative and participatory modeling are clear and it is high time to investigate
        them in detail.
    </p>

    <p>This workshop aims to unearth the visceral synergies between collaborative and participatory
        modeling in a
        full-day format, entertaining technical presentations, keynotes, and a participatory discussion
        session.</p>
